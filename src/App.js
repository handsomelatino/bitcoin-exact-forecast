            <h3>How much for 1 btc?</h3>
            <p>1 btc = 1 btc</p>
            <p>In other words one bitcoin is equal to one bitcoin.</p>

            <h3>How much is 1 bitcoin now compared to 2009?</h3>
            <p>If you invested and bought 1 btc in 2009, you would have exactly 1 bitcoin today.</p>

            <h3>What do you mean by 1 btc = 1 btc. Is this website a cheap prank?</h3>
            <p>It may be a prank (but not a cheap one!) since it was designed and programmed using quite some effort.</p>
            <p>But also, the main idea is that there is a <strong>fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin,</strong> meaning that if you own 1 bitcoin now, you will always own (at least) 1 / 21 millionth of the supply.</p>
            <p>That's approximately 0.000000048% of the supply. It sounds like an incredibly small number, but once you realize there are almost 8 billion (~7,900,000,000) of us in the planet, this means that <strong>less than 0.2 percent of the population can <u>ever</u> own more than 1 bitcoin.</strong></p>

            <h3>This is stupid. $1 USD = $1 USD. 1 Eur = 1 Eur. Right?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you are correct... unless you add a time frame to that calculation.</p>
            <p>Say you owned a $1 bill in 1980. Adjusted for an annual inflation rate of 3.12%, that dollar would only be worth 28 cents now.</p>

            <h3>But Inflation Is Goodâ„¢</h3>
            <p>You can do your own homework and resarch and get your own perspective about inflation. But no matter how you see it, everyone will agree that hyperinflation is a <em>not</em>good thing.</p>
            <p>Maybe 1980 sounds like it happened a long time ago. So let's just take into account the official figure of inflation for the last two years (2019 to 2021): about 10%.</p>
            <p>I will tell you my own personal story: I saved up $50,000 in the bank for cushion and in those two years inflation ate $5,000</p>
